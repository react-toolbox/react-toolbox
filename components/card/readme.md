# Card

A [Card](https://material.google.com/components/cards.html) is a piece of paper with unique related data that serves as an entry point to more detailed information. For example, a card could contain a photo, text, and a link about a single subject.

Cards are composed of multiple subcomponents in React Toolbox. You can combine each of the subcomponents to create all different Material Design Cards given in the spec.

<!-- example -->
```jsx
import { Card, CardMedia, CardTitle, CardText, CardActions } from 'react-toolbox/lib/card';
import {Button} from 'react-toolbox/lib/button';

const dummyText = 'Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.';

const TestCards = () => (
  <Card style={{width: '350px'}}>
    <CardTitle
      avatar="https://placeimg.com/80/80/animals"
      title="Avatar style title"
      subtitle="Subtitle here"
    />
    <CardMedia
      aspectRatio="wide"
      image="https://placeimg.com/800/450/nature"
    />
    <CardTitle
      title="Title goes here"
      subtitle="Subtitle here"
    />
    <CardText>{dummyText}</CardText>
    <CardActions theme={theme}>
      <Button label="Action 1" />
      <Button label="Action 2" />
    </CardActions>
  </Card>
);

return <TestCards />;
```
