# Menu

A [Menu](https://material.google.com/components/menus.html) is a temporary piece of material emitted from a button, an action, a pointer, or another control that contains at least two menu items. Each menu item is a discrete option or action that can affect the app, the view, or selected elements within a view. Menus should not be used as a primary method for navigation within an app. You can compose a menu based on a few subcomponents, same as for Lists.

<!-- example -->
```jsx
import {IconMenu, MenuItem, MenuDivider } from 'react-toolbox/lib/menu';

const MenuTest = () => (
  <IconMenu icon='more_vert' position='topLeft' menuRipple>
    <MenuItem value='download' icon='get_app' caption='Download' />
    <MenuItem value='help' icon='favorite' caption='Favorite' />
    <MenuItem value='settings' icon='open_in_browser' caption='Open in app' />
    <MenuDivider />
    <MenuItem value='signout' icon='delete' caption='Delete' disabled />
  </IconMenu>
);
```

If you want to provide a theme for any of these subcomponents via context, the component key is `RTMenu`.

## Menu

This subcomponent is the default wrapper for a menu and is responsible for the opening behavior. Its properties can affect to the Item children.
