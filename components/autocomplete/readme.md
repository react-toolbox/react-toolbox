# Autocomplete

An input field with a set of predeterminated labeled values. When it's focused it shows a list of options that are filtered by label as the user types. They can be simple or multiple depending on the amount of values that can be selected. The opening direction is determined by its current position at opening time.

<!-- example -->
```jsx
import Autocomplete from 'react-toolbox/lib/autocomplete';

const source = {
  'ES-es': 'Spain',
  'TH-th': 'Thailand',
  'EN-gb': 'England',
  'EN-en': 'USA'
};

class AutocompleteTest extends React.Component {
  state = {
    countries: ['ES-es', 'TH-th']
  }

  handleChange = (value) => {
    this.setState({countries: value});
  };

  render () {
    return (
      <Autocomplete
        direction="down"
        selectedPosition="above"
        label="Choose countries"
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        source={source}
        value={this.state.countries}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

If you want to provide a theme via context, the component key is `RTAutocomplete`.

## Theme

This component uses an `Input` under the covers. The theme object is passed down namespaced under `input` keyword. This means you can use the same theme classNames from `Input` component but namespaced with `input`. For example, to style the label you have to use `inputLabel` className.

| Name     | Description|
|:---------|:-----------|
| `active` | Used for a suggestion when it's active.|
| `autocomplete`  | Used for the root element.|
| `focus`   | Used when the input is focused.|
| `input`   | Used to style the `Input` component.|
| `suggestion`   | Used to style each suggestion.|
| `suggestions`   | Used to style the suggestions container.|
| `up`   | Used for the suggestions when it's opening to the top.|
| `value`   | Classname used for a single value.|
| `values`   | Classname used for the values container.|
