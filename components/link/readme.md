# Link

The link is a very simple component that acts mostly as a wrapper for the HTML anchor. It's not included in Material Design Specification but we provide it as an easy way to create links with icons and counters. Let's see an example:

<!-- example -->
```jsx
import Link from 'react-toolbox/lib/link';

const LinksTest = () => (
  <nav>
    <Link active href="/#/components/link" label="Work" count={4} icon='business' />
    <Link href="/#/components/link" label="Blog" icon='speaker_notes' />
    <Link href="/#/components/link" label="Explore" icon='explore' />
  </nav>
);
```

If you want to provide a theme via context, the component key is `RTLink`.

## Properties

You can add as many properties as you want to be directly transferred to the output anchor element. Apart from them you have the following properties:

| Name            | Type                  | Default         | Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
